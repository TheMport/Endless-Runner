Ideaology : 

Game Name: "Attack On Cyan"
Game description: An endless runner that some what resembles geometry dash where you can only constrol the jumping while
the game moves for you. As you progress the backround will be changing between a varaint of colors. You will have to avoid
obstructions by choosing what platforms you decide to jump on. Ideally there would be a random box that players can collect
and it changes the character "Cyan" to a different shape with new capabilities.
